# instant-send-app

Instant Send is a Telegram Mini App with a frontend using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI, and a backend with Node.js, Grammyjs Telegram Bot API, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. It generates Solana wallets by converting a mnemonic to a seed (BIP39) and deriving an HD path (BIP44) to create keypairs via NaCl, encoding the private key in Base58. Wallets (public/private keys, mnemonic) are shown for 60 seconds, then removed, with events logged to the backend. Circleâ€™s USDC stablecoin facilitates transactions, potentially using CCTP for cross-chain transfers. If a user sends USDC to another without a CTRL wallet, an escrow smart contract in Rust is set up for later redemption. The frontend and backend are on Vercel, and the Grammy bot runs on a custom server. Telegram contacts are shared manually, storing only names and UIDs in PostgreSQL.
Further, for product analytics, it uses PostHog, a platform to analyze, test, observe, and deploy new features.
